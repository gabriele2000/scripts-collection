When moving media files from Google Photo to another cloud, I had to create a way to automate the convertion of **a lot** of images (we're talking about 10k+ images) while retaining one of the most important aspect of the file: the creation date.

I created those scripts to aid myself in this task, recently I made them more interactive.

They're useful for both videos and images.

The only dependency is `avifenc`
